## What if I do not have USB access to my own machine?

Some unfriendly IT departments might not allow access to the USB ports on your corporate laptop. :(

One option is to pair up with someone else, which is a big part of the fun.

We have also brought a couple of Raspberry Pi computers for you to SSH into and use to flash boards. Please let us know if you need help with this.
