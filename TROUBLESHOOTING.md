# Troubleshooting

## What if I do not have USB access to my own machine?

Some unfriendly IT departments might not allow access to the USB ports on your corporate laptop. :(

The best option is to pair up with someone else, which is a big part of the fun.

## The drone or robot keyboard commands do not seem to work in Windows

Make sure you are running your programs in the normal command prompt and not the git bash prompt, so that go-termbox works as expected.
