## What if I do not have USB access to my own machine?

Some unfriendly IT departments might not allow access to the USB ports on your corporate laptop. :(

The best option is to pair up with someone else, which is a big part of the fun.

## My Gopher Badge is not powering up with battery connected

If your battery is connected and switching your badge to ON doesn't power it up, **disconnect your battery, switch to ON and connect your battery again**. If it doesn't power up, then check the battery charge.
